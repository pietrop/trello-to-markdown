The idea is basically if you have a transcription Json ( for simplicity's sake let's assume in it's simplest form as an array of word objects with Start and end timecode attributes) how to create an srt where the lines/words  are well spaced and timed appropriately, automatically .  If that makes sense?

Could refactor this:
